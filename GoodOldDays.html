            <big>      I wish somebody would have told me, babe
                Someday, these will be the good old days
                All the love you won't forget
                And all these reckless nights you won't regret
                Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
                You'll miss the magic of these good old days
               
                I was thinkin' 'bout the band
                I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
                We were underground
                Loadin' merch in that twelve-passenger van
                In a small club in Minnesota
                And the snow outside of 1st Ave
                I just wanted my name in a star
                Now look at where we at
                Still growin' up (Woo, ooh), still growin' up (Woo, ooh)
                I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become (Woo, ooh)
                Couldn't wait to get older (Woo, ooh), couldn't wait to be some (Woo, ooh)
                Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
                Those good old days
                
                I wish somebody would have told me, babe
                That someday, these will be the good old days
                All the love you won't forget
                And all these reckless nights you won't regret
                'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
                You'll miss the magic of the good old days
                Wish I didn't think I had the answers
                Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
                Wish I made it to homecoming
                Got up the courage to ask her
                Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
                Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
                Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
                And felt comfortable in myself
                Rooftop open (Woo, ooh), and the stars above (Woo, ooh)
                Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love (Woo, ooh)
                Me, you and that futon (Woo, ooh), we'd just begun (Woo, ooh)
                On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
                Those good old days
               
                I wish somebody would have told me, babe
                That someday, these will be the good old days
                All the love you won't forget
                And all these reckless nights you won't regret
                'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
                You'll miss the magic of the good old days
               
                Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
                Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
                Maybe these are the moments
                Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
                Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
                While missin' out on now
                We've come so far (Woo, ooh), I guess I'm proud (Woo, ooh)
                And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile (Woo, ooh)
                I've got some scars (Woo, ooh), I've been around (Woo, ooh)
                I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
                Those good old days (Oh, oh, oh)
                
                You don't know (Woah, oh, oh) what you've got (Woah, oh, oh)
                'Til it goes (Woah, oh, oh), 'til it's gone (Woah, oh, oh)
                You don't know (Woah, oh, oh) what you've got (Woah, oh, oh)
                'Til it goes (Woah, oh, oh), 'til it's gone (Woah, oh, oh)
               
                I wish somebody would have told me, babe
                Someday, these will be the good old days
                All the love you won't forget
                And all these reckless nights you won't regret
                Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
                You'll miss the magic of these good old days</big>
